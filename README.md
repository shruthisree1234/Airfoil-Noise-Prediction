# Airfoil Noise Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting the self-noise generated by airfoils using real-world data and Spark ML. The ability to accurately forecast noise levels is critical in aeronautics and related fields to design quieter, more efficient aircraft and wind turbines.

## Problem Statement

Aerodynamic noise from airfoils impacts operational efficiency, environmental compliance, and passenger comfort. This project builds a complete data workflow—from raw data ingestion and cleaning to model training and deployment—enabling reliable prediction of airfoil sound pressure levels under various physical and design conditions.

## Dataset

- **Source:** NASA airfoil noise dataset (variant used in project, similar to [UCI Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/airfoil+self-noise))
- **Main Features:**
    - Frequency (Hz)
    - Angle of attack (degrees)
    - Chord length (meters)
    - Free-stream velocity (m/s)
    - Suction side displacement thickness (meters)
    - Sound pressure level (dB) – Target

## Approach

### 1. ETL Pipeline
- Load CSV and create Spark DataFrame
- Remove duplicates and nulls
- Rename columns for clarity
- Store clean output in Parquet format

### 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- Assemble features using `VectorAssembler`
- Standardize features with `StandardScaler`

### 3. Model Development
- Build linear regression model using Spark ML
- Construct end-to-end pipeline combining preparation and modeling stages

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model with MSE, MAE, and R² metrics on test data

### 5. Model Persistence & Inference
- Save the trained pipeline/model
- Reload pipeline and verify consistent predictions

## Results

- **Best Model:** Spark ML Linear Regression  
- **Test Metrics:**  
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 18.60  
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.19  
    - R² Score: 0.92  
- **Insight:** Frequency and airfoil geometry parameters are strongly predictive of noise.
